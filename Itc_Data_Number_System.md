# ItC Week 2 - Number System & Data
###### tags: `Intro_to_Comp`

- Part1
  -
  - Pyramid strcuture
    - more advanced, more expensive components are less in number
  - Abstract / Layering
    - hiding unimportant details
  - Discipline
    - intentional restriction
    - hardware example: analog &rArr; digital
    - software example: single thread &rArr; multi processing
  - Three -Y
    - hierarchy
      - divide system into modules & submodules
    - modularity
    - regularity


- Digitaliztion
- Binary system
- Hexadecimal system
  - makes binary numbers more readable
- Signed number
  - sign/magnitude number
    - 1 sign bit + N-1 magnitude bits
    - sign bit is msb (most significant bit)
    - issues with addition between positive and negative number
    - overflow problem
    - have 2 representation for 0
  - 2's complement number
    <!-- - $ A : {}$ -->
    - $ A = a_{n-1} (-2^{n-1}) + \sum_{i=0}^{n-2} a_i 2^i $
    - starting from the smallest number
    - instead of fliping numbers by 0
    - msb still indicate sign
    - flipping all bits then +1 equals negative
- Number extension

- Text repersentation
  - ASCII, extended ASCII, Unicode
  - Words as high dimentional vectors
- Sound representation
- Image representation
- Data compression
- Logic gates
